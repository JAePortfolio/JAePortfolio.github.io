                <h4>Car shopping</h4><hr>
                <h5><u>August 2020->Present</u></h5>
                <p1>I have wanted a car for a while now and finally am going for it. But it's been quite a pain. I would say I'm probably more knowledgeable in looking at cars than the average person, so I'm much more thorough in my searches. In my searches, the majority of them have been scams so far or people lying.<br>
                    For example, one of the first ones was a Golden Beach Camry with 91k miles. Long story short, after some digging I found out the car was actually near 200k miles. I confronted the owner and he disappeared after trying to say oh that's impossible, even though I had proof.<br>
                    Another common one is dealers pretending to be private owners of cars. I word my questions carefully to check for this, and had a guy asking me "Where did I see the ad?", and "What price is it? My friend is selling my car for me". Your friend sells your car for you and you don't know what price he's selling it for? Yeah, sure.<br>
                    After about almost 10 people pulling my leg, I finally got someone who was honest and serious. Unfortunately I was too slow to the ball, and the car was sold when I went to go see the car! Pic of it below, I really liked it!

                    So now, after a month, my search continues, although I may be taking more of a break from it, since it gets tedious dealing with the scammers, liars, etc.
