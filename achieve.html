            <dt>Playoffs- Team Leader</dt>
            <dd>I lead a competitive eSport team for approximately 4.5 years.
                It was a group of 21 players, with 9 (including myself) being
                the main line up. I created a positive atmosphere with clear
                communications between all players (9 people talking at once
                can be hectic, so you have to learn/teach how to communicate)
                . I created trust with other team leaders, which ensured us 
                practices. Blah blah blah I lead our team to playoffs(out of 500)
                twice. </dd>

                highschool. </dd>
