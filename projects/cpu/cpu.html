                <h4>Single Cycle CPU</h4><hr>
                <p> This is my final project for my Computer Architecture. Me and 3 other students
                    out of 80 were the only ones to complete it. The objective is to
                    design a 32-bit CPU based on the 32-bit MIPS instruction set. 32-bit meaning the 
                    addresses are 32 bits, the data elements are 32-bit integers, instruction length, 
                    etc. I implemented R and I type instructions. Below is a demonstration.<br>

                </p>
                </hr>
                <h5><u>Software and Hardware</u></h5>
                <p1>This Single Cycle CPU is designed on Intel's Quartus and implemented on
                    the Altera DE2-70 Development and Education Board. The language the programming
                    is done is VHDL.<p1> </hr>
                <h5><u>The Design</u></h5>
                <p2>A single cycle CPU is a CPU that does everything on a single clock cycle.
                    Load things into registers, computations, incrementing PC, etc. It can be seen below.
                    <br><img src="images/singleCycleCPU.PNG" alt="Single Cycle CPU" width="600" height="400"><br>
                    A 32-bit instruction is fed into the instruction memory, and each part of 
                    the 32-bit instruction goes to different components. A lot of components here
                    I have designed and simulated using VHDL in previous labs, such as the 32-bit SRAM for 
                    the instruction memory, the 32-bit adder to increment the PC counter. My source/work can 
                    be found on my github, the link beind under the links section of this website.
                </p2></hr>

                <h5><u>How it works</u></h5>
                <p3>In the above picture, notice the paths. The instruction is "broken up" and sent to 
                    through different paths, for example, bits 31-26 of the instruction go to control unit, which 
                    basically act as an opcode. These then activate certain enable lines depending on the opcode, for 
                    example, a memory write, a branch, etc. Bits 25-21, 20-16, are sent to the registers unit, etc. 
                    All the groups of bits are needed for different parts, again, per based on the MIPS architecture. 
                    Below is a video of the design. <b>Note, it's sped up due to my professor's requirements.</b><br>

                </p3>

                <h5><u>The Challenge</u></h5>
                <p4>The challenge of this will be to get everything to be done under 1 cycle. How is this a challenge?
                    Well instructions can take certain time, some longer then others. For example, a branch
                    instruction doesn't need much, you just need to add to the PC, whereas a Memory to Register takes more
                    time. So you have to have the instructions take long be able to complete under a single cycle just like 
                    the instructions that are not as long.
                </p4>
