                <h1>Small Java Program</h1>
                    <p>This is a small project assigned as one
                        of the last two projects assigned in my CSC 221-Sofware
                        Design Lab. We were to create a program that read a dictionary
                        file and be able to render a histogram pie chart on the screen
                        depending on the user input! The chart would show the occurence
                        of letters, depending on how many letters the user inputed to see.
                        </p1>
