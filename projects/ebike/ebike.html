                <h4>Smart eBike Kit</h4><hr>
                <p>For my Senior Capstone, I lead and managed a team of 4 to design a Smart eBike Kit. This would be a product that can be sold on the market that would allow you to transform a mountain bike into an eBike. An eBike is an electronic bicycle, which generally consists of a battery and a motor. Our kit will have this, but also a smartphone application that communicates with the various modules, and an object detection system using LiDAR.
                </p></hr>
                <h5><u>Software and Hardware</u></h5>
                <p1>Every module (other than the battery management system) was designed by us. We created hardware schematics and PCBs in KiCAD. The modules communicate and send signals via our Raspberry Pi. For the software side, our smartphone application was prototyped with the assistance of Blynk (an IOT platform). We used C++. The smartphone application communicates to the Raspbery Pi via bluetooth.
                </p1>
                <h5><u>The Design</u></h5>
                <p2>Below is a blueprint created in AutoCAD. This was our finalized design of how the kit would look when deployed onto a mountain bike. (TO BE CONTINUED...)
