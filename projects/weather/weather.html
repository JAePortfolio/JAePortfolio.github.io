                <h4>Weather Visuals Through Python</h4><hr>
                <p> This is a small project that's currently in-progress. One of my hobbies
                    since I was young is my YouTube Channel I run which documents weather
                    events, specifically extreme weather events, such as Blizzards, Hurricanes
                    etc. As I was learning Python over the Past Summer, I decided something
                    I could do with Python is created Data Visualizations for my YouTube 
                    for things such as average snow fall rates over a few years, or the 
                    expected snowfall rate each hour of an upcoming snow storm, etc 
                </p>
                </hr>
                <h5><u>How it's done</u></h5>
                <p1>There is a few steps to doing this. Obviously you need some code to do
                    this which can be viewed on my Github (check out my links section).
                    Once you have the code, it can be easily be recyclced over and over
                    for different charts/graphs, the main thing that changes is the data.<br>
                    My data is generally coming from the <abbr title="National Weather Service">
                    NWS</abbr>. The data they collect is available to the public, all you
                    have to do is download it. The data I also may just create myself, such as 
                    expected wind speed.  Then I put it into my directory I'm working in,
                    run my program and vaulla! This is the jist of it. Then I can use it 
                    in a video. Maybe I'll show expected snowfall rates for a storm coming that night
                    or maybe the increase in wind as the storm rolls on, etc. <p1> </hr>
                <h5><u>The Code!</u></h5>
                <p2>The code utilizes a few Python libraries so obviously we don't have to
                    reinvent the wheel. With each different graph or chart, obviously I 
                    change the axises for whatever I'm graphing. For example, the x-axis
                    will be time, while the Y-axis can be MPH for wind, or tide height.
                    Then I can save these if I ever want to reuse them.<br>
                    Then after I download the appropriate data or create it, I simply feed 
                    it's directory to the line that needs it in the code. Then I run and 
                    save the graph/chart. </p2></hr>
                <h5><u>How I use or plan to use  it in my videos!</u></h5>
                <p3>So whenever a major storm is coming, I make plans to make a video.
                    You can find more information about my youtube channel in general
                    in the SOMETHING section. I'll use snowstorms as an example since they
                    are my favorite. Before a storm starts, I generally make a video 
                    discussing what's going to happen. I can use a graph to demonstrate 
                    snowfall rate's over a 12 hour period. I can have the x-axis from 3am 
                    to 3pm with 1 hour intervals, and the y-axis having 0, 1 and 2 inches.
                    Generally NYC doesn't ever get 3 inch snow fall rates, so I wouldn't pass
                    2. Then I can just a line graph to give an easily readable visualization
                </p3>
