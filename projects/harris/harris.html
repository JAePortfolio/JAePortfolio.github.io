                <h4>3D FloorPlan</h4><hr>
                <p>This was a project I did in 12th grade and continued into my first year of 
                    college. The reason I'm putting it here is this was my favorite class in HS. 
                    The class was Computer Aided Design and Drafting. Below is a carousel of some 
                    renderings of the finished product. (There is a mix of before and after designs here).
                    Drag with your mouse, finger or press the small circles to go through.</p>

                <h5><u>The Project</u></h5>
                <p1>If you haven't read about this class on my blog, long story short
                    I was Mr.Harris's top student. I excelled 1000% percent in his class
                    compared to other students, and so we discussed me taking one of
                    his old 2D floorplan project's I did the previous semesters,
                    creating 3D models for everything, applying textures and creating
                    HD-renders. Mr. Harris let me go at it.</p1>
                <h5><u>How I started</u></h5>
                <p2>So first we choose which floorplan to do. I really don't remember
                    how we choose one, but we did choose one. Now keep in mind,
                    I did this all in AutoCAD. AutoDesk 3DS Max is really more suitable
                    for 3D models, but AutoCAD can do it if you know how to do it. 
                    Things such as walls are easy, I really just have to use the pull tool
                    and pull them to the appropriate height. But other models require 
                    much more work.<br> 
                    I started with the Kitchen, since I figured it has lot's of things
                    going on. You have a sink, fridge, oven, island, cabinets, etc.
                    All things to model!. After that I went onto the bathroom, and soon other 
                    places in the house. Note I came up with some newer designs after HS, so you
                    can see a difference in the different renderings.</p2>
