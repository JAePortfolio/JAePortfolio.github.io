                <h4>3D FloorPlan</h4><hr>
                <p>This was a project I did in 12th grade. The reason I'm putting
                    it here is this was my favorite class in HS. The class was
                    Computer Aided Design and Drafting. I would say this 
                    final project  cemented the idea in me that I like designing/creating
                    things and wanted to pursue something involving that. (You
                    can read more in my blog about it!)</p>
                <h5><u>The Project</u></h5>
                <p1>If you haven't read about this class on my blog, long story short
                    I was Mr.Harris's top student. I excelled 1000% percent in his class
                    compared to other students, and so we discussed me taking one of
                    his old 2D floorplan project's I did the previous semesters (I 
                    took this class since my second half of 9th grade and onwards except
                    for one semester, but you can read about that again in my blog) and
                    creating 3D models for everything and applying textures and creating
                    HD-renders. Mr. Harris let me go at it.</p1>
                <h5><u>How I started</u></h5>
                <p2>So first we choose which floorplan to do. I really don't remember
                    how we choose one, but we did choose one. Now keep in mind,
                    I did this all in AutoCAD. AutoDesk 3DS Max is really more suitable
                    for 3D models, but AutoCAD can do it if you know how to do it. 
                    Things such as walls are easy, I really just have to use the pull tool
                    and pull them to the appropriate height. But other models require 
                    much more work.<br> 
                    I started with the Kitchen, since I figured it has lot's of things
                    going on. You have a sink, fridge, oven, island, cabinets, etc.
                    All things to model! I decided to go for the island first, since
                    it has mostly simple shapes I can start with. </p2>
