                <h2>Data and Statistcal Analysis Projects</h2>
                <p>This was my last lab done for my first Electronics Lab I've taken in
                    school. The reason I decided to put a lab in my projects is I believe
                    this lab shows a lot of tools I can use and skills I gained .
                    Those being
                    <ul>
                        <li>MATLAB</li>
                        <li>LabView</li>
                        <li>MSW</li>
                        <li>DC Power Supply</li>
                        <li>Digital Multi-Meter</li>
                        <li>Ability to write in-depth Lab Reports</li>
                    </ul>
                    .Before we get into it though.. </p>
                <h4><u>About this class!</u></h4>
                <p1>Generally with classes I take, like most students I suspect, we generally
                    like to find out how the class is in terms of difficulty, courseload, how
                    the professor is, etc. I generally try to ask fellow students on the
                    school's facebook page (that is if I even have my FB account activated
                    ,you can find out about that on my blog section). Then I always look
                    on the website ratemyprofessor! When I saw the reviews for this
                    professor, I was thinking this class would be horrible. Apparently
                    these were the main problems with the class:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The lab's are difficult</li>
                        <li>The professor is of no help, leaves you on your own whole semester,
                            never said a word other then the first day of class the whole semester</li>
                        <li>The lab reports are extremely long, don't expect an A unless 50 page
                            reports </li>
                        <li>The professor is mean</li>
                    </ul>
                    But how wrong they were. I've generally learned this is how 
                    ratemyprofessors work. Students who've done bad go on there and give
                    horrible ratings cause they are mad at the professor for not passing them
                    for just showing up. <br>
                    I remember the first day of class after the lab workers explained 
                    the dangers and what not of the tools and where to pick up our lab-kits,
                    our professor began to talk. He eventually got to say <q>I know I see 
                        on rate my professor 'Oh need 50 page lab report for A', not true!
                        just give me good amount, 20-30 pages, and follow this format!</q>
                    He then proceeded to write the format for the lab-report on the board. I wrote
                    this down and always followed it!<br>
                    Long story short I did extremely well in this class, I got an A. Halfway 
                    through my group members dropped the class since they couldn't handle
                    the courseload, so I was on my own. I was the only one scoring 90+'s
                    on each lab. Go check out my blog post on it to find out how I made it
                    through this class and how I did well! </p1> <br>
