            <section>
                <h5>The Hours continued...</h5>
                <p>So what are the Q1-Q4 markings. These pins are raised to logical 1 or logical 0 depending on 
                    the current number. Let's say the current number is 5. For a 4-bit number, in binary, 5 is 
                    0101. So Q1=1, Q2=0, Q3=1, Q4=0. This will come in handy for when we need to set the clock back
                    to 01 after the 12th hour. 
                </p>
                <p>To cascade these chips together, the datasheet for the chips actually explains it pretty well.
                    "If the CARRY-IN input is held low, the counter advances up or down on each positive going clock
                    transition. Synchronous cascading is accomplished by connecting all clock inputs in parallel and
                    connecting the CARRY-OUT of a less significant stage to the CARRY-IN of a more significant
                    stage." So in the hour 12 example, 2 is the less significant digit. We bring the right digit's 
                    CD4510 CARRY-OUT pin to the CARRY-IN pin of the left digit's CD4510 pin. The CARRY-IN of the 
                    right digit's CD4510 is grounded, along with the left digit's CARRY-OUT, as they are not used.
                </p>
                <p>The P0-P3 are the pre-set values. Remember, we want to preset the display to 01. Using Reset 
                    will cause it to go to 00, which is good for a 24 hour clock, not 12 hour. Again, we have to 
                    set pins to logical 1 or 0 depending on what we want. For 01, the left digit is 0, the right
                    digit is 1. So, P0-P4 on the left digit's CD4510 is all grounded for logical 0. For 1 on the
                    right digit's CD4510, P0 is set to logical 1, and P1-P3 is logical 0, since 0001 = 1. 
                </p>
                <p>Now how do we get the chips to know when to preset. We can think of this logically. We want the 
                    clock to preset to 01 when there is a 1 on the left side AND a 2 on the right side. The keyword 
                    there is AND, this should make us think of an AND gate. AND gates if you aren't familiar output 
                    a 1 only when both of its inputs are 1. You can also say its output is TRUE when both Inputs are
                    True. Any other combinations results in 0 or false at the output. 
                    <br>
                    The chips we have for the AND gate are called CD4081. For this specific chip, each AND gate has 
                    2 inputs. Some are designed to have more then 2 inputs. This will raise an issue in a moment.
                    <br>
                    Before we get to it, we have to think about something. Do we want reset the clock as it hits 12, 
                    or as it hits 13? Since this clock triggers on the positive edge (so right as it hits a new pulse)
                    we want to preset when we have a 1 and a 3. If it was a 1 and a 2, it would switch right as we are 
                    getting to 2, so we would never even see the 2 display. 
                    <br>
                    So now this is where the problem of the AND gate comes into play. We have 2 inputs for the AND gate. 
                    So we think let's input a 1 and 3. The problem is, remember in binary, a 3 is not represented by 1 
                    'digit', it's 2 digits. For a 4-bit number, its 0011. So that would need 3 inputs! How do we solve this?
                    We don't have a 3 input AND gate, so what we can do is just use 2 AND gates. We'll use 1 AND gate to check
                    if the right digit is a 3. So we check Q1 and Q2 of the right digit's CD4510. If they are put 1, it will 
                    ouput a 1 on the AND gate. We feed that output to the input of the second AND gate. So the second AND gate
                    has the input of logical 1 since 3 has appeared, and now it needs its second input to be from the left digit
                    when it has a 1. Since 1 is 0001, we just need 1 pin, so we can connect Q1 of the left digit's CD4510 into the 
                    AND gate. These are our inputs. Now when both are true, AKA, 13 is next, the AND gate will output a logical 1.
                    We feed that into the preset lines of BOTH CD4510. It will tell it to activate PRESET, and will PRESET to the
                    values that are on P0-P3 of each clock, which we said before are set to display 01 on the clock.<br>
