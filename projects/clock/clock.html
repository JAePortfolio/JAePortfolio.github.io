                <h3>Why this project?</h3>
                <p>For my Electronics 1 Lab, this was our last final project. 
                    Unfortunately, I couldn’t finish it in time for class. Not 
                    because of me, but long story short because of the various 
                    winter storms we had during the semester, things would be 
                    pushed back, and so there just wasn’t enough time for this 
                    project. The good thing was the professor dropped the lowest
                     grade, so it did not affect my grade since I had no other 
                     lower grades.</p>

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p1>The project is to design a 12 hour digital clock with minutes
                     and seconds and 12 hours being 1, 2, 3..12pm/am.<br>
                    It is designed to be built with<br>

                <h3>Definitions</h3>
                <p2>If you are familiar with the items above, I suggest you jump to 
                    the next section.<br><b>Digital Integrated Circuits</b> allows 
                    electrical circuits to implement a variety of things such as logical,
                    combinatorial,sequential and other functions. One example of one 
                    is the picture below.<br>
                    <center><img src="../../images/projects/clock/exampleIC.gif" alt="Example IC"
                    width="125" height="125" align="middle"></center>
                    The pins can be for different things. Basic ones are Voltage and Ground, others 
                    can be depending on the IC. For example, one may be to divide by 2. On another IC, 
                    a pin can be an AND gate.<br>My design of the clock will start off with a wiring diagram 
                    that shows the routing of the wires connecting the pins of various IC’s to each other, 
                    the seven segment displays, etc.<br>
                    <b>Seven Segment Displays</b> is a display with seven segments to form the numbers 0-9.<br>
                    <center><img src="../../images/projects/clock/ssdexample.png" alt="Example SSD"
                        width="125" height="125" align="middle">
                        <img src="../../images/projects/clock/ssddiagram.png" alt="Diagram of Segments"
                        width="125" height="125" align="middle"></center><br>
                    The segments as you see in that picture are labeled by letters. DP means "Decimal Point". 
                    or example, if you had 2 of these displays lined up, and wanted to display 3.7, you would 
                    have the DP light up as well. They also sell these with 2 digits instead of just one digit.<br>

                    Each segment is an LED (the ones I used at least, I believe there are other types).  So if you 
                    look at the pic of the diagram and lit up F and E, the number 1 appears.<br>

                    Excuse the quality, I filled that in MS Paint real fast, but you get the idea. (If you look 
                    at the white instead, it looks like a 3 ;D)<br>
                    <b>Crystal Oscillator</b> This is a component that will eventually be used to provide a clock signal 
                    to make the clock count. The crystal in the crystal oscillator consists of a small piece of 
                    quartz crystal that is in a metal can. It's connected to a logic gate configured to act as an 
                    amplifier. The crystal has a natural resonant frequency of the quartz crystal determines the 
                    frequency of the oscillator.<br>

                    <b>Power Supply/12 V battery</b> The 12V battery should be self-explanatory . Power Supply is a piece 
                    of equipment that just provides power. In the model below, you have three channels where you can
                    set different voltages using the various buttons on the devices. You connect it to your board's 
                    Va, Vb, Vc etc, or right into the board's shorting holes.<br>

                <h3>An important lesson learned when I started</h3>
                <p3>If you aren't interested in this just jump to the next section. Now as I said before, I really 
                    didn't get to finish this project in lab, in fact I barely had the time to start it. But I did 
                    at least mess around with the Seven Segment Displays. Before the actual project, the manual asks
                    you to just display a 1 on the seven-segment display using the DC Power Supply. Now for the 
                    seven-segment display provided, it has 2 digits and has a forward voltage drop of 2 V. It is
                    noted a current ID that is greater than 25mA (milli Amperes) will blow out the segment.  
                    So we need some resistance. The manual said to aim for 13mA to pass into it with VDD = 9 V. 
                    So using Ohm's law which states<br>V=IR<br>Which states the voltage equals the current multiplied
                    by resistance, it's simple math. I just need to solve for the resistance, <b>R</b>. So<br>R=V/i<br>
                    But there is a voltage drop of 2V, so the total voltage is 9-2=7V.<br>7V/(13mA)=538.46 Ohms, which
                    you can round a bit higher to be on the safe side, os maybe 550 ohms.<br> Now the second time I did 
                    this I made a big mistake that cost me. The ssecond time I went about this in my lab class, I believe
                    I didn't use a resistor, I forget why now, I think I saw another classmate doing it (which I should of
                    not have followed since they were all doing horrible), and I was getting nothing on one of the segments,
                    but the others were working. I eventually figured out quickly I damaged the component. What did we learn
                    here?<b>Follow basic instructions and just use common sense!</b><br>The lab workers told me they 
                    didn't have any extras. What I did over the summer was order some of my own, they are not expensive.
                    I think I spent 5 bucks for 4. Now after I got them, I did it with the correct resistance and it
                    worked fine.<br>By the way, here's a picture of what I was supplied with! You can see the IC's 
                    and the Seven Segment Displays ^^. Sorry for the quality, camera isn't the best.<br>

                <h3>The Hours</h3>
                <p4>The first part I tackled was the hours. They require the least numbers to count so why not (1-12,:P)
                    In reality the lab manual tells you to start with this.<br>For this first part, we will need three
                    components<br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>BCD to Seven-Segment Drive IC (Binary Coded Decimal)</li>
                        <li>Seven-Segment Display</li>
                        <li>BCD Counters</li>
                    </ol>
                    <b>BCD to Seven Segment Driver</b>-So in computers if you didn't know, espcially in IC's, 0's and 1's 
                    are used. Binary Code is used to represent things such as other numbers. So we need a IC to be able 
                    to convert the binary code to decimal numbers (1, 2, 3 etc) to display on the Seven Segment Display.<br>
                    <b>BCD Counters</b>- This is an IC that simply counts up or down which count in BCD and binary.<br>
                    So, for the clock, it will display like this for the hours. 01, 02, 03...09, 10, 11, 12.<br>So, the 
                    highest digit(before getting confused, recall the definition of a digit) 
                    will be 9, NOT 12! The reason which I should of said before is even though these
                    Seven Segment Displays have 2 digits, each digit are "separated". They don't work together
                    counting, so the left digit has to count only between 0 and 1, and the right digit 1-9. It's not 
                    one whole display.<br>So, since the highest number is 9, we are going to need a 4 bit number.4 bit 
                    numbers cover 0-15, because 2^4=16 numbers. The 2 comes from having two possibilities, 0 and 1, and 
                    the 4 is the size. If we used 3 bit, it would be 2^3=8 numbers, or 0-7, which is missing 8 and 9 
                    which we need. In BCD, no number exists above 9 though, so...<br>
                    <center><img src="../../images/projects/clock/dectobcd.png" alt="A Decimal to BDC Conversion Chart"
                         align="middle"></center><br>
                    If we wanted let's say the number 453 to display using 3 Seven Segment Display, the BCD code equivalent
                    would be-4:0100, 5:0101, 3:0011.<br>The IC provided, CD4543 that we will use is designed to have an input
                    BCD and the output that can drive the seven-segment display. The good thing with this IC we don't need 
                    to use any resistors!<br>In our given kit, we were given to different BCD counters. The part numbers
                    are CD4510 and CD4518. Both have the same function which is to count, but the CD4510 is presetable.
                    Why is that important? Because a 12 hour clock displays 1-12,  we obviously want to start from 01 as 
                    the hour, not 00,so we want to preset at 01!<br>
                </p4>
                <p5>Now that I explained each function of the components, let's discussing hooking the components up!</br>
                    <b>PLACE HOLDER HERE PIC</b></br>In this pic, the lab manual has already drawn out some connections we
                    need to make. For example, we are to connect the a,b,c....g from the seven segment driver to the a,b,c... 
                    g on the seven segment display. Now keep in mind from what I wrote before, I broke my 2-seven segment
                    displays, so I had to order new ones from amazon. Unfortunately it seems 2-seven segment displays are 
                    only sold in large bulks, or in special orders, such as a custom kit. So I had to buy single seven segment 
                    displays. Would this be a problem? Not really! Because if you notice in the diagram, each set of letters
                    corresponds to the position of each LED for EACH digit! So I can just place the single seven segment displays
                    next to each other, and it would look and function the same way!</br>
                    Now let's look at the other connections. Even though they are just given, I wanted to see why they are connected 
                    the way they are. Also, there are some things not given, that we have to figure out! So we can look at what
                    each pin does by looking at their data sheets! *INSERT A DEF*. According to the data sheet for 
                    the CD4543 (seven segment driver), it says 2^3, 2^2, etc are the BCD inputs! And it makes sense. 
                    Remember, we said before we need 2^4 bit size to represent the numbers we need. 2^3+2^2..+2^0 = 15, 
                    which is equal to 2^4 (0-15). Then we use 2^3, 2^2, etc inputs to represent each bit in the 4 bit number 
                    (a bit more on that later). The "Ph" and "Bl", which stand for Phase and Blanking, have multiple ways of
                    being connected, depending on certain things. It says for an LED device, Phase is set
                    to logic 0 for common cathode seven segment displays, and logic 1 for common anode. The difference between
                    the two according to University of Hawaii says "The difference between the two displays is the common 
                    cathode has all the cathodes of the 7-segments connected directly together and the common anode has all 
                    the anodes of the 7-segments connected together". If you look at the diagram that came with your seven segment
                    display or datasheet, it will tell you which you have. For these single segment displays I bought, I have a common
                    anode display. So I'm suppose to set Phase to Logic 1. There is also a truth table, where it says 
                    Blanking is always set to 0.<br> How do we set things to logic 1 and logic 0 you ask? For some of you this may 
                    come to you as intuition, for some of you, it may not. The lab manual explains though. Essentially logic 1 is a 
                    Vdd (power supply voltage in this case), and logic 0 is ground (0 volts). Our power supply can be a Digital Power 
                    Supply, or a 9V battery.<br>Now, for the marking Q1-Q4.... INSERT TEXT.
