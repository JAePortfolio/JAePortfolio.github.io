        <h4>About Me</h4><hr>
        <h5><u>Education</u></h5>
        <p1>Hi! Welcome and thanks for visiting my website :D. As of May 2020, I have
            earned my B.E in Computer Engineering at CCNY! <br>
            I originally went to NYIT on a Presidential Scholarship but had 
            to transfer back to my original choice CCNY for personal reasons 
            that I do not want to post online, but it was not due to academic reasons. <br>
        </p1>

        <h5><u>Current Employment</u></h5>
        <p2>I currently work as a tutor for Varsity Tutors, where I tutor things such as Intro to Programming, Algorithsm, Calculus, etc. I also previously worked simultatenously as a IT intern for RFCUNY at PS1 Bergen. </p2>

        <h5><u>Why Computer Engineering?</u></h5>
        <p3>
            Why did I choose Computer Engineering? When I was younger, 
            I always enjoyed creating and building things! For example, I 
            turned cardboard into a beautiful Titanic replica, perfecting the
            ships curves and everything. The next reason is in 4th grade, I joined 
            a computer club started by my teacher Ms. Mac (Ironic name :P). I 
            don't remember why. One day this kid showed me all these commands
            he knew how to do using the keyboard. When he copy and pasted 
            using ctrl+c and ctrl+v, I thought it was the coolest thing
            ever haha. Ever since then computers fascinated me. <br><br>


            Finally the last reason and a big one was watching Knight Rider. 
            <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/knightrider/images/8/8f/Knight_rider_intro.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20180608092909&path-prefix=en" alt="Knight Rider" class="center" style="width:400px;height:200px;"></p>
            I liked cars when I was younger and seeing K.I.T.T was just
            a world of wonder to me. The sleek black car, the crazy dashboard
            , it looked like an engineering marvel to me. Plus of course, the A.I,
            K.I.T.T (Knight Industries Two Thousand). I hope to own a black Firebird one day!<br>

        </p3>
        <h5><u>Now - 5 Year Plan</u></h5>
        <p4 style="margin-left: 40px">
            So now here I am. As of May 2020, I have graduated! It was a long and tough journey, but I made it. 
            I definitely have learned a lot and grew over my academic career. One important thing I learned is 
            never ever give up!<br> So what now? Over the next 5 years, I plan to primarily focus on finding 
            a place to move into that has a yard and a garage for a car. The reasons being I would like a place
            where my dog can live the rest of his remaining years (he is currently 9 years old) and so I can 
            have a place for a car that I can use to take him places. As for career wise, I hope to be working 
            somewhere where I can perhaps work in embedded systems. I have come to liking programming working at
            lower hardware level (hence my capstone project). Maybe also be specifically in the automotive industry.
