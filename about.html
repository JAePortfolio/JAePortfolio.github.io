        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Hi! Welcome and thanks for visiting my website :D. I am
            currently in my junior year at The City College of 
            New York, a student of the Grove School. I am
            studying Computer Engineering! <br>
            I originally went to NYIT on a Presidential Scholarship
            but I decided to transfer a bit later to my original
            choice, CCNY. <br>
            Why did I choose Computer Engineering you may ask?
            Well, when I was young, I always enjoyed creating
            and building things! I use to try to make things 
            out of anything I could find, for example, I made
            a replica of the Titanic using cardboard from 
            cereal boxes and tissue boxes! Then I "painted"
            it, and it actually amazed my family how good it 
            looked, it didn't look like cardboard at all!
            The next reason is, in 4th grade, a computer club
            was started by my teacher Ms. Mac (ironic name :P)
            and I asked my mom if I could join it. Why? I honestly
            don't remember. There was this one kid there, I don't 
            remember his name, he kind of looks like the Brain 
            from PBS's arthur. I remember he used Ctrl+C
            to copy and paste something when we were learning 
            powerpoint, cause we were told to right click, click 
            copy, press paste, so I asked him, how are you doing 
            that without right clicking! He showed me Ctrl+C,
            and I thought it was the coolest thing ever! From there
            I was fascinated with computers <br> </p>
            <p1>
            But I would say what really got my interest in computers  was the show
            Knight Rider. If you don't know it, it was a show that 
            ran during the 1980's. It was a mix of Sci-Fi and Detective
            themed. It was about this man, Michael Long, who was 
            on a case with his partner, both undercover detectives.
            Long story short, his partner was killed by the people
            they were going after, and soon Michael was betrayed by
            someone who he thought was on his side, but was actually
            working for the people who he was chasing. She shot him
            point blank in the skull, leaving him for dead in the desert.
            The Foundation for Law and Government, a seperate entity, was also
            onto these people and knew they were going to kill Michael, but,
            the founder of the foundation, Wilton Knight, had someone fly him
            in his helicopter to the location, but, as he said "My god we're too late".
            They brought him back to FLAG, and Wilton's personal doctors/surgeons 
            said it's a miracle he survived because he had a metal plate from
            military surgery in his forehead, which deflected the bullet, 
            causing the bullet to come back out of his face, so they had
            to reconstruct his face. A few months later after his injuries and
            face surgery healed, they took his bandages off. Later on, we find out
            Wilton Knight is dying (very old), infact when they were discussing how
            Michael survived, the doctor said Michael is probably the only  
            man on the planet who's in worse condition then he is". Wilton was a
            WORD HERE and inventor, computer scientist as well. His last work was
            building an A.I for the US government, but took his work back
            as he felt there should be more use of it then sitting in a 
            government computer. I will get back to this point in a minute.
            Wilton believed in common law, helping people, etc, but he
            also believed sometimes only direct action to a problem
            is the only feasible solution. So he created the "Pilot Program",
            which was one man and one car. The man was Michael (whom they
            picked even before he was shot) and the car was something Wilton
            and his team of engineers, scientists, designed called the
            KNIGHT 2000. He took the A.I. he created and decided to make it
            the brains of the car. It was called the Knight Industries Two
            Thousand, K.I.T.T for short. K.I.T.T's primary programming was 
            the preservation of human life, specifically Michaels. Wilton
            asked for Michael for his help, to go after Tanya and her friends
            (Tanya was the one who shot Michael), as the placed they worked
            for was a place called Comtron, and I quote "She's working in a placed
            called 'Silicon Valley'" :P, remember, it's 1982, Silicon Valley 
            was just starting. Tanya and her friends are trying to steal
            new technologies to sell off to the highest bidder, for example,
            a bubblememory chip. Wilton was a victim of their crimes. 
            On his death bed, this was the dialogue <br>
            Wilton: You were spared to lead great fight, don't turn away in fear.
            One man can make a difference, and you are going to be that man.<br>
            Michael: Mr. Knight, I like to be able to promise you, that I can
            take on the world some day but I can't. I still wake up in the
            middle of the night shaking, the whole world blown up in my
            face<br>
            Wilton: Remember that moment, think of it as your baptism
            by fire.<br>
            Wilton reaches out his hand to grab Michaels
            Wilton: My adventure has ended, yours has just... has just..
            begun.<br>
            He passes away at that moment. 
            Michael soon gets a new identity<br>
            Michael: Michael Knight?<br>
            Devon (Wilton's long time trusted Friend): Michael Long is dead
            remember that<br>
            Michael: How do I suddenly become Michael Knight<br>
            Devon: Yes, well *proceeds to show him the rest*<br>
            Michael: Driver's license, credit cards<br>
            Devon: All under Mr. Knight's orders<br><br>
            So at this point Michael drives off after a bit of a conversation
            Later on<br>
            Michael: Time to put on some music, all these weird gadgets, you think
            they'd give you a radio<br>
            KITT: What would you like to hear?<br>
            Michael: What the HELL WAS THAT *stops the car*<br>
            KITT: Do you wish further information on Silicon Valley<br>
            Michael: Hellll no I want to know who you are and how you're
            listening in<br>
            KITT: There's no reason for increased volume, I'm scanning your
            interogatives quite satisfactorally. I'm the voice of Knight Industries
            2000's microprocessor. K I T T for easy reference, KITT if you prefer<br>
            So Michael wasn't exactly thrilled with KITT at first, he felt
            he was being spied on, but Devon tries to tell him he (KITT) is
            on your side, Michael being irritable goes "But I'm the one out HERE
            all on his lonesome. I can get my face shot off, not it"<br></p1>
            <p2>So... good job if you read all that. KITT again was an A.I,
                in a basically tank of a vehicle, bullet proof, contraptions,
                abilities like being able to launch in the air to jump,
                drive on 2 wheels, ejector seats, able to crash through
                concrete, etc, Auto-Pilot, etc. It was so amazing to me,
                incredible, to see an A.I do this, control all this,
                and car itself was sleek, cool, "hotrod" even, just 
                pure awesomeness. That's just 10% of what KITT
                could do. There's so much stuff more computer wise, not mechnical like
                the things I just wrote about. It made me so interested in computers, how
                they could work to maybe do functions like that. Now of
                course, it is sci-fi, but a lot of things are becoming reality
                just in todays world, ex self-driving vehicles. KITT became
                an icon of the 80s, and is still referenced in pop-culture
                and many other ways today. </p2> 
            
            <p3>Later on throughout Middle School, I started doing 3D design and
                tiny bit of code modifying Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. Infact,
                me and 2 others were doing a modification to create Back to the
                Future! Unfortunately due to a fight among us, it broke apart.
                But, that's when I got interested in coding and making a game
                do something, and also putting my 3D model in it. </p3>
            
            <p4>In high school, I joined the CADD program, taught by Mr. Harris.
                He was my favorite teacher and it was my favorite class. We used
                AutoCAD, which I never used, but I've used 3DS Max by Autodesk, so
                I've seen AutoCAD. I quickly became top of the class, and was
                one of Mr. Harris's top student. Infact, one of my final projects
                he assigned to just specifically me because the stuff in class
                was too simple for me is on the projects section of this site!
                Go read on it for more details on what it was ^^. 
                I soon was on my way to graduation. I found out a classmate, 
                was also one of Mr. Harris's top students. He was interested 
                in architecture, and infact now he goes to CCNY with me, but
                under the architecture program. Senior awards night was coming
                up and he told us he's only allowed to give out one award. 
                That night, it was given to me :D. I got an award for 
                Excellence in Computer Aided Design and Drafting and a medal
                too! Now I really never got to use AutoCAD in any of my studies
                but I still loved CADD as I just loved creating stuff :D. 
                I'll never forget Mr. Harris's class, I think it had a big 
                impact on my decision in choosing my major. Infact, he 
                wrote me a recommendation letter for the colleges I applied to
                and I believed it made a big impact on being accepted by CCNY's
                engineering school as I know its appectance rate at the time
                wasn't big.</p4>
            
            <p5>So, how did computers, KITT, 3D Design, and Mr. Harris's class
                equate to computer engineering? Well I figured I loved creating
                and building things, I liked computers, how they functioned, how
                I could make it do something, so I figured, why not combine
                them both! :D </p5>
